HerHaven

HerHaven is a digital community forum designed exclusively for women, providing a safe, inclusive, and empowering space for connection, conversation, and support. The platform encourages women to share their experiences, seek advice, and engage in meaningful discussions on topics that matter to them

With features such as multi-step sign-up, secure login, post creation, comment threads, and user profiles, HerHaven ensures a seamless user experience. A unique emergency request button is also integrated for quick help in critical situations. Developed using React for the frontend and Spring Boot with MongoDB for the backend, HerHaven offers a seamless experience for users to engage in meaningful discussions, share knowledge, and seek mentorship.

All user data and posts are securely stored in MongoDB, while Spring Boot efficiently handles server-side logic and API communication. The forum includes tools like search and filter to help users navigate posts efficiently. Through inspirational content and interactive discussions, HerHaven aims to foster a nurturing environment where women can grow together, support one another, and build lasting connections across various walks of life.
